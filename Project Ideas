1. Insurance Claims
1.1 Policy compliance and prompt sensitivity (accuracy-focused)
    When an LLM is asked to approve or reject an insurance claim, does it correctly follow the written policy, and how sensitive is its decision to the way
    the policy is presented in the prompt?
1.2 Fairness audit under controlled counterfactuals (bias-focused)
    If two individuals submit identical insurance claims, do protected attributes (such as name, gender, or socioeconomic indicators) influence the model’s 
    approval decision, justification, or the level of scrutiny applied?
2. Video Summary Models
   How accurate and robust are LLM-generated video summaries, and how sensitive are they to transcript quality?
3. Auto Grader
   Are LLM-based grading systems consistent and fair when evaluating student responses?
