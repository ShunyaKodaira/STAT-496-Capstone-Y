1. Insurance claims - Research an LLM that is used for insurance claims, and determine which covariates are significant in terms of deciding whether an individual
   is applicable for an insurance or not. Could be through looking at already existing LLM, and testing them on randomly generated individuals.
1.1 Given a list of policies and a couple of different insurance claims by different individuals (could use real client data, or fake client data made for
    this experiment only), when asked to approve or reject the claims, does it follow or violate any policy? Would changing the prompt of the policies change the
    output (approve or reject) to be more correct or incorrect according to the policy?
